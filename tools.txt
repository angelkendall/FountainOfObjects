OOP 1:
Encapsulation - Combining data (fields) and the operations on that data (methods) into 
a well-defined unit (like a class).

OOP 2:
Information Hiding - Only the object itself should directly access its data.

OOP 3:
Abstraction - The outside world does not need to know each object 
or class's inner workings and can deal with it as an abstract concept. 
Abstraction allows the inner workings to change without affecting the outside world. 

OOP 4:
Inheritance - Basing one class on another, retaining the original class's functionality while 
extending the new class with additional capabilities.

OOP 5:
Polymorphism - Derived classes can override methods from the base class. The correction version
is determined at runtime, so you will get different behaviour depending on the object's class.
